# Cleanup-Conundrum

Title:
Cleanup Conundrum

Brief Exposition:
Youâ€™ve been tasked with cleaning up Oceanview Road, known for being the dirtiest road and beachfront in the beautiful city of Cleanville. You play as Donna, an ocean conservationist, Johnny, a recently paroled convict who was tasked with community service, Billy, a disgruntled recycling collector, or Mikey, a young traffic director who needs more hours. Your task is to collect trash on the road and beachfront while competing against your fellow volunteer who is trying to do the same thing.

Genre/Theme:
 Simulation (Environmental collector)

Gameplay Short: 
You rush around a beach or some other natural environment, picking up trash and tossing it into your truck to dispose of it, trying to beat your friend in how much trash you can clean up in the time you have in the day. Ex. Player 1 runs across the sand, picking up bottles and snack bags around before chucking them in the garbage truck at the starting side of the map, watching his points climb up as the timer ticks down. Player 2, much to his dismay, tries to go in the water to help a turtle out of a tangle of plastic, but a jellyfish floats by and zaps him, stunning him for multiple seconds as he watches his buddy pull away with the lead.
